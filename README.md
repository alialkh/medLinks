# MedStudent Dashboard

A simple, frontend-only dashboard for medical students to access common resources quickly. Designed to look like a phone home screen.

## How to Use
Simply open `index.html` in any web browser. No installation or server required.

## Adding More Links
To add more websites, open `script.js` and add a new entry to the `resources` array at the top of the file:

```javascript
{ name: "New Website", url: "https://example.com", color: "#your-color-hex" },
```

## Customization
- **Colors**: You can change the color of the icons in `script.js`.
- **Styles**: Edit `style.css` to change the appearance.
